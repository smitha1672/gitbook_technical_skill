+ Case 1

If the master only writes to the slave device then the data transfer direction is not changed.

+ Case 2

If the master only needs to read from the slave device then it simply sends the I2C address with the
R/W bit set to read. After this the master device starts reading the data.

+ Case 3

Sometimes the master needs to write some data and then read from the slave device. In such cases it
must first write to the slave device, change the data transfer direction and then read the device.
This means sending the I2C address with the R/W bit set to write and then sending some additional
data like register address. After writing is finished the master device generates repeated start
condition and sends the I2C address with the R/W bit set to read. After this the data transfer
direction is changed and the master device starts reading the data.
